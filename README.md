# VCHTTPConnect
This is wrapper around the awesome SwiftHTTP library. The intention here is to be as simple as possible when making HTTP connections.

All the code was done by me, so please if you think you can contribute, lets share some thoughts!

When I get some time I will update this with detailed description of each class / method.

Here's a link to the original SwiftHTTP: https://github.com/daltoniam/SwiftHTTP
